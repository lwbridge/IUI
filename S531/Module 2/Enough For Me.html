<h1>Enough For Me</h1>
<h2>Fadwa Tuqan</h2>

<p>
<br>Enough for Me<br>
<br>Enough for me to die on her earth<br>
<br>be buried in her<br>
<br>to melt and vanish into her soil<br>
<br>then sprout forth as a flower<br>
<br>played with by a child from my country.<br><p>

<p>
<br>Enough for me to remain<br>
<br>in my country's embrace<br>
<br>to be in her close as a handful of dust<br>
<br>a sprig of grass<br>
<br>a flower.<br><p>
