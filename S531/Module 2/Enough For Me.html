<h1>Enough For Me</h1>
<h2>Fadwa Tuqan</h2>

<pre>
Enough for Me
Enough for me to die on her earth
be buried in her
to melt and vanish into her soil
then sprout forth as a flower
played with by a child from my country.<pre>

<pre>
Enough for me to remain
in my country's embrace
to be in her close as a handful of dust
a sprig of grass
a flower.<pre>
