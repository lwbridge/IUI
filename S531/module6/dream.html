            <h2>My Dreams and Nightmares</h2> I have the dream of being a Youth Services librarian for children in need. Specifically children in Black and Brown neighborhoods that are impoverished. More children ,especially black children, in poor neighborhoods are denied the use of books and have less books inside the home than children the same age in high income homes. These pockets of places are called book deserts. I want to get a book car and deliver free books to these children or provide free books at book fairs for them. I was a poor child and reading has brought me so much joy and peace. I want to give that to other children like me. I also have dreams of living in my own home and being comfortable. I want to be able to go on many trips with my friends and family. I want to see my niece going to a good college.

            <h2>My Loves</h2> These are my friends; <br> <img src="images/steps.jpg" alt="group smiling on steps"> <br> I met them online. Which I do not recommend doing unless you are very comfortable with yourself and have a good gut for people. I go on a trip to see them once per year because we all live in different  places. I love them dearly. We are going to Ohio this year! </aside>
