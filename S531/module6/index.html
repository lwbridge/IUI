            <h2>The Beginning</h2> Hello! <br> 
My name is Leila Bridgewater. I am 24 years old. I was born at the end of the 90s so I know what a floppy disk is but I have forgotten how to put it into a computer.I was born in Kentucky and grew up in Southern Indiana! I have three siblings. Two biological and one adopted. I graduated from High school in 2018.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2> I love anime and collecting Kpop Merch and Albums. I played the clarinet in High school and I was in the Marching band. I also played in the Purdue Gold Band until my Sophomore year. I love sewing even though I'm not good at it. I also love to write letters and collect fountain pens and wax to seal my letters with.
