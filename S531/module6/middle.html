The Middle of my life has been looking rough recently. I went to Purdue and studied Speech Language and Hearing Sciences so I know a weird amount about people's ears, nose, throat, and the neural connections to learn language but not enough to do anything useful. I knew from an early age I wanted to help people. I guess I just naturally ended up in Youth Services so now I am getting my Masters in Library Sciences, and I work at my childhood library.
I have one cat. Her name is Mint <br> <img src="images/mint.jpg" alt="cat being cute"> <br>
and she is simultaneously mean and very sweet. I trained her to walk on a leash, shake hands, jump up, and we are working on rolling over!
